# Welcome!
Welcome to The Arborway Committee for Public Transit, Inc. (ACPT). Organized by residents and merchants in Boston’s Jamaica Plain neighborhood in the 1970s, ACPT’s goal is to advocate for improved public transit service in Boston’s Jamaica Plain neighborhood and more generally throughout greater Boston. As a neighborhood organization we seek vibrant and inter-connective transit services. In doing so we work with other community organizations, our political representatives, and the business community to achieve these goals.
