# Welcome!
There is a growing movement to provide improved transit service on South Huntington Avenue in Jamaica Plain to support new residential development now being constructed and to make Boston's Latin Quarter, Hyde Square, more widely accessible. To accomplish this The Arborway Committee for Public Transit, Inc. (ACPT) proposes extending the Green Line to Hyde Square. See our White Paper on the proposal. Our White Paper, assembled by the Arborway Committee for Public Transit, Inc., discusses key factors favoring the extension of the Green Line along the South Huntington Avenue corridor to Hyde Square from Heath Street in Jamaica Plain. Our best efforts have been made to ensure accurate and timely information.

Even without any further development along South Huntington Avenue, an extension of the Green Line to Hyde Square would greatly benefit current neighbors and merchants and alleviate the inadequate service currently provided by the Rt. 39 bus.
