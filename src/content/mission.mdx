**Our Current Major Transit Initiative** is the .065-mile extension of the E-branch of the Green Line along South Huntington Avenue from its Heath Street,
Jamaica Plain terminus  to Hyde Square, Bostonâ€™s Latin Quarter, also in Jamaica Plain. The E-branch operates as both a light rail and streetcar service
connecting northern Jamaica Plain into the Boston subway system. The importance of extending the service is underscored by the fact that Hyde Square is
an environmental justice neighborhood lacking a rail connection to downtown Boston. In addition, in 2013, the Boston Planning and Redevelopment Agency (BPDA)
designated South Huntington a "development corridor." Development has already attracted hundreds of new residents to the area with more to follow.
