        <Typography>Why extend the Green Line to Hyde Square?</Typography>
    </AccordionSummary>
    <AccordionDetails>
        <Typography>
            Extension of the line to Hyde Square will connect Hyde Square and adjacent neighborhoods directly to the central subway. It will provide no-transfer public transit to and from Park Street Station and Government Center for the increasing number of residents on South Huntington Avenue and in adjoining neighborhoods. The extension will also provide a more reliable and comfortable ride than the Route 39 bus.
