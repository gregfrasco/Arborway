**The Arborway Committee for Public Transit, Inc** is a volunteer group of residents and merchants of Boston that advocates for quality public transit in the urban environment. Founded in 1976 our chief objective has been to advocate for Jamaica Plain's one seat ride into the central subway system, currently referred to as Boston's E-Line, a branch of the Green Line.

**We are also a 501(c)(3)** tax-exempt organization with a mission to educate and inform decision makers on the benefits of public transportation. We sponsor a number of community discussion meetings in Jamaica Plain and the city at large.

**How can you help?** Donate or follow us on Twitter or Facebook for news, information and opinion on Boston transportation. See our Support page for more information.
