**Our On-Going Major Transit Initiative**  is the 0.65-mile extension of the E-branch of the
Green Line along South Huntington Avenue in Jamaica Plain from its existing Heath
Street terminus to Hyde Square, Jamaica Plain, Boston’s Latin Quarter. The E-branch
is a streetcar service connecting northern Jamaica Plain by rail to, and into, the
Boston subway system. The importance of extending the service to Hyde Square is
underscored by the fact that Hyde Square is an environmental justice neighborhood
that lacks a rail connection to downtown Boston, which extending the service would
address. In addition, the Boston Planning and Redevelopment Agency (BPDA) has
designated South Huntington Avenue a "development corridor". Development has
already attracted hundreds of new residents to the area with more to follow.
