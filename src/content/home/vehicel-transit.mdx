With growing attention to reducing carbon-based emissions caused by the nationâ€™s transportation
system, there is impetus across the board to transition to electric-powered vehicles. Transit is no
exception. Increasing the use of electric vehicles for transit contributes greatly to the goal of
reducing carbon emissions because transit, in moving greater numbers of people per vehicle,
provides more carbon-efficient transportation than personal automobiles. In addition, unlike
diesel, hybrid diesel, and compressed natural gas buses, electric transit vehicles produce no
point-of-service tailpipe emissions, thereby improving the air quality in neighborhoods that
transit serves. Green Line streetcars for the proposed Hyde Square extension are electric and will
promote neighborhood air quality. Extending high capacity, high frequency, clean urban electric
transit is also an effective way of meeting national climate action goals.
