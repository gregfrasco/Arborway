Transit Vehicle Electrification (TVE) is becoming an important element of transit planning. Several factors are energizing the movement including improving urban air quality, lowering noise emissions, and reducing
operating costs for transit agencies. Many cities already have the traditional forms of electric transit vehicle including streetcars, light-rail, and trackless trolleybuses (TTB).  For instance, The Arborway Committee
for Public Transit, Inc. supports the extension of Boston’s Green Line streetcar service to Hyde Square to meet the needs of improving air quality in the Hyde square area, an environmental justice neighborhood. Additional
newer concepts of TVE include “in-motion charging” (IMC) electric vehicles, “in-route charging” (IRC) electric vehicles, and electric battery powered vehicles. These are not mutually exclusive alternatives; transit systems
can operate a variety of electric vehicles. In cities that experience very cold and very hot temperatures, and in cities with hilly bus routes, TTBs and IMC buses have an advantage because these factors require a higher
draw on electric power, which TTBs and IMC buses can provide without service interruptions. IRC and electric battery buses can work very well in cities with moderate temperatures, and on shorter haul and flatter surface
route configurations. The Sierra Club identifies the future of bus transit as electric.* [TransitMatters.org](http://transitmatters.org/) encourages both IMC and IRC charging bus operations.
