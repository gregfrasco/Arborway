According to the US Department of Transportation (DOT), “Environmental Justice (EJ) is the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, income, national origin, or educational
level with respect to the development, implementation and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations and policies.”* Regarding design and construction of transit projects, DOT seeks “to avoid, minimize, or mitigate
disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects, including social and economic effects, on minority populations and low-income populations; to ensure the full and fair participation by all
potentially affected communities in the transportation decision-making process; [and] to prevent the denial of, reduction in, or significant delay in the receipt of benefits by minority and low-income populations.”**
For example, transit agencies applying for federal grants to fund transit projects are required by DOT to assess a project’s impact on the health and environment of low income and minority populations. This assessment
focuses on impacts during the planning, construction, and ultimate operation of the transit project. Additionally, the policy requires that the transit agency engage in community outreach to allow for meaningful
participation by EJ populations to assure that the transit infrastructure contemplated meets their needs.
