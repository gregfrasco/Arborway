Our proposed Green Line extension to Hyde Square will serve an Environmental Justice (EJ) neighborhood. In designing and constructing transportation projects, the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) requires cities
and states to promote Environmental Justice. EJ seeks “to avoid, minimize, or mitigate disproportionately high and adverse human health and environmental effects, including social and economic effects, on minority populations
and low-income populations; to ensure the full and fair participation by all potentially affected communities in the transportation decision-making process; [and] to prevent the denial of, reduction in, or significant delay
in the receipt of benefits by minority and low-income populations.” For example, transit agencies applying for federal grants to fund transit projects are required by DOT to assess a project’s impact on the health and environment
of low income and minority populations. This assessment focuses on impacts during the planning, construction, and ultimate operation of the transit project. For more on EJ, visit DOT at:
