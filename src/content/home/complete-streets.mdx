Fostered by the National Complete Streets Coalition,* the “complete streets” movement seeks to encourage cities and states to design and construct roadways that allow all travelers equal use of the road.
“All travelers” includes not only automobile drivers, but also pedestrians, bicyclists, and users of public transit. For example, regarding public transit, the Coalition states, “In too many cases, road design is out of sync with the needs of the people who are riding buses, trains, and trolleys.
Poor design slows transit service and discourages people from using public transportation ... Nearly every transit trip begins as a walking trip — but the disconnect between transit and road planning means transit riders are often left to wait at bus stops marked by a lone post in the grass — no sidewalk,
curb ramp or bench.”  Designing a “complete street,” therefore, means that the entire right of way is viewed and built as a multi-modal avenue that provides travelers with a variety of transportation choices that are safe and convenient regardless of travel mode. Such new visioning of urban streets requires,
for example, sidewalks of ample width, pedestrian destination signage, clearly marked bicycle lanes or separated bicycle tracks, and convenient and safe access for cyclists and pedestrians to bus and rail stops.
According to the Coalition, without such improvements, viewing roads as avenues primarily for the automobile reduces “opportunities for safe travel choices that can ease congestion: walking, bicycling, and taking public transportation.”
