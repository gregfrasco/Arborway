According to the Complete Streets Coalition, “Complete Streets are streets that work for all users, not just
those using a car.” Designing a “complete street,” therefore, means that the entire roadway is
viewed and built as a multi-modal avenue that provides travelers with a variety of transportation
choices that are safe and convenient regardless of travel mode. Such new visioning of urban
streets requires, for example, sidewalks of ample width, clearly marked bicycle lanes or
separated bicycle tracks, and segregated bus and streetcar lanes. In keeping with this road sharing
concept, the U.S. Department of Transportation encourages cities to adopt complete streets
policies that change the way transportation decisions are made and streets are designed. For
