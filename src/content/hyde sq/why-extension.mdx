In addition to providing service to the Hyde Square neighborhood, the extension would complement the
“South Huntington Framework for Future Development” launched in 2013 by the Boston Planning and Redevelopment Agency (BPDA).

the proposed “Go Boston 2030” initiative <a href='#'>Read the 2030 initiative here</a> and MASSDOT’s “Focus 40” initiative <a href='#'>Read the 2040 initiative here</a>. Overall, benefits of the extension to residents, merchants, and institutions are many.
