##### **The Green Line Hyde Square extension is part of a wider public transit vision for the Boston region.**

**South Huntington Avenue Development Corridor**

It not only serves the Hyde Square neighborhood, but the extension would also complement the “South Huntington Framework for Future Development” launched in 2013 by the Boston Planning and Redevelopment Agency (BPDA). [Read BPDA’s Framework Here](http://www.bostonplans.org/getattachment/ab568032-681d-49e4-9c25-c68d6078a1b1) (at pg. 33)

**Go Boston 2030 and MASSDOT Focus 2040**

Further, the extension has been incorporated in both the proposed “Go Boston 2030” initiative [Read the 2030 initiative here](https://www.boston.gov/sites/default/files/file/document_files/2017/03/go_boston_2030_-_7_projects_and_policies_spreads_1.pdf) (at pg. 162) and MASSDOT’s “Focus 40” initiative [Read the 2040 initiative here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57757a3cff7c50f318d8aae0/t/5c904501f9619a6b93cd1ee0/1552958737005/05-Programs.pdf) (at pg. 45). Overall, benefits of the extension to residents, merchants, and institutions are many.
