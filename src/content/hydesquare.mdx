##### What is Boston's Latin Quarter?

Over the past 60 years, waves of immigrants from Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Central and South America have
landed in the Hyde-Jackson neighborhood of Jamaica Plain seeking new opportunities. But over the past 25 years the Hyde Square Task Force (HSTF)
has taken the lead in a mobilization to transform this neighborhood into a bustling business and cultural district. In Boston’s Latin Quarter
one finds crowded Dominican barbershops, a variety of Latin cuisine, Whole Foods, corner bodegas, and restaurants catering to the foodie demographic,
while cars cruise by blasting the latest Bachata hit song. The diversity of businesses demonstrate both the Latino roots of the neighborhood as well as
the more recent influx of young professionals/families, hipsters and artists. With a wide range of incomes, races and ethnicities, the Hyde Jackson
neighborhood has been described as one of Boston’s most diverse communities.
