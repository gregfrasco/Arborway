##### Why Extension to Hyde Square?

In addition to providing service to the Hyde Square neighborhood, the extension would complement the
“South Huntington Framework for Future Development” launched in 2013 by the Boston Planning and Redevelopment Agency (BPDA).
[include link to the framework with the language: Read BPDA’s Framework Here] Further, the extension has been incorporated in both
the proposed “Go Boston 2030” initiative [include link to the 2030 initiative with the language: Read the 2030 initiative here] and MASSDOT’s “Focus 40” initiative [include link to the 2040 initiative with the
